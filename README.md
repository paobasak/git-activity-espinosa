Git and GitHub
Git is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in code and allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on a project. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git and owned by Microsoft. It hosts Git repositories online, providing tools for collaboration, code sharing, and project management. In essence, Git manages version control, while GitHub offers an accessible platform to use Git’s features conveniently and collaboratively.
